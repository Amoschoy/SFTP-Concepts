---steps---

###Generate a key pair (public and private) for the consumer system  
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "RSA 4096 bit Keys"

###Generate a key pair for Active Transfer server
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "RSA 4096 bit Keys"

###Store the consumer system's public key in AT
1) Go to Certificates, click on add
2) Fill in the fields and browse for source system's public key which was generated earlier
3) Click save

###Store the AT's public key and private key in AT
1) To store AT private key, Go to certificates, click on add
2) Fill in the fields and browse for AT's private key which was generated earlier
3) Click save

### To store AT public key, Go to certificates, click on add
1) Fill in the fields and browse for AT's public key which was generated earlier
2) Click save

###Create a listener on Active Transfer
1) Go to listener tab and click on add
2) Fill in the Name: ATserver, Host: localhost and Port:2002
3) Click save

###Create a user
1) Click on users tab and click add to create a new user called dev1
2) Add the source system public key under Trusted Public SSH key alias

###Save AT's public key in source system
1) In source system VM, create a file called authorized_keys inside .ssh folder
2) Save the AT public key in this authorized_keys file


---SFTP commands---
$ sftp -P 2002 dev1@192.168.11.1 (to connect to AT SFTP server from SOURCE)
sftp > put test.csv (upload file to AT server from SOURCE)


ssh-copy-id installs an SSH key on a server as an authorized key. 
Its purpose is to provide access without requiring a password for each login. 
This facilitates automated, passwordless logins and single sign-on using the SSH protocol.

$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/activetransfer_rsa.pub source@77.134.54.101 -p 2222
